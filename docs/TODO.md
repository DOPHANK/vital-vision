# Next Steps for OCR-to-LLM Project

With the basic environment set up, the next steps will involve implementing the core functionalities of the project. Below is a detailed guide for each step:

## 1. Implementing the OCR Service
- **File**: `src/ocr/ocr_service.py`
- **Objective**: Develop the OCR functionality using EasyOCR or PaddleOCR. This service will take images as input and return the extracted text.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize the OCR models.
  - Implement functions to handle image preprocessing, text extraction, and error handling.
  - Write unit tests to ensure the OCR service works correctly with various image inputs.

## 2. Setting Up the LLAMA Integration
- **File**: `src/llm/llama_service.py`
- **Objective**: Integrate the LLAMA 3.1 model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. This service will process the text provided by the OCR service.
- **Tasks**:
  - Load the pre-trained LLAMA model.
  - Implement functions to handle text input, model inference, and output generation.
  - Ensure the service is optimized for the available hardware on the on-site server.
  - Write unit tests to validate the functionality.

## 3. Building the Processing Pipeline
- **File**: `src/pipeline/pipeline_service.py`
- **Objective**: Create a pipeline that integrates the OCR service and LLAMA service. This pipeline will manage the flow of data from image to final text output.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design the pipeline flow, ensuring that data is passed efficiently between services.
  - Implement the pipeline to handle asynchronous tasks.
  - Write unit tests to confirm the pipeline processes various types of inputs correctly.

## 4. Creating the Database Models
- **Files**: Within `src/`, add files for database models, such as `models.py`.
- **Objective**: Define the database schema using SQLAlchemy, focusing on tracking input requests, output responses, feedback, and errors.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define models for storing processed text, request metadata, error logs, etc.
  - Implement database interactions using SQLAlchemy sessions.
  - Write migration scripts if necessary.
  - Write unit tests for database operations.

## 5. Implementing the Celery Tasks
- **Files**: Create tasks in `src/pipeline/tasks.py`.
- **Objective**: Implement Celery tasks to manage OCR processing, LLM processing, and other background operations asynchronously.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define and register Celery tasks for the OCR and LLM processing.
  - Ensure tasks can handle retries, timeouts, and failures gracefully.
  - Integrate Redis as the Celery broker.
  - Write unit tests to ensure tasks execute correctly.

## 6. Adding Logging and Monitoring Tools
- **Files**: Implement logging in `src/utils/logger.py`.
- **Objective**: Set up a comprehensive logging and monitoring system using Loguru and other tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement application-wide logging using Loguru.
  - Set up logging configurations for different environments (development, production).
  - Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana if needed.
  - Write unit tests to ensure logs are generated correctly under different scenarios.

## Conclusion
Once these steps are completed, the core functionalities of your OCR-to-LLM system will be ready for testing and further optimization. Each step includes implementing the necessary components, ensuring they work as expected, and validating them through unit tests.
